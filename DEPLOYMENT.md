## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

Since GitHub CLI isn't available, create the repository manually:

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository named `gold-rush-drifter`
2. Make it public
3. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

```bash
cd /app
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gold-rush-drifter.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your `gold-rush-drifter` repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect Vite settings:
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
5. Click "Deploy"

The `vercel.json` file is already configured for proper routing.

### Step 4: Ship to itch.io

#### Option A: Manual Upload
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Zip the contents of the `dist/` folder
3. Upload to itch.io as HTML5 game

#### Option B: Automated (Recommended)
1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Add secret `ITCH_API_KEY` with your Butler API key
3. Edit `.github/workflows/itchio.yml` and replace `YOUR_ITCH_USERNAME` with your actual username
4. Create a release tag: `git tag release-0.1.0 && git push --tags`
5. GitHub Actions will automatically build and upload to itch.io

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start**: Click "Start Bounty" or type `bounty std`
2. **Combat**: Click "Attack" or press `2` to fire your revolver
3. **Reload**: Click "Reload" or press `3` when out of ammo
