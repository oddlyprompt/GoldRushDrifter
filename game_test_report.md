## Game Features Verification ‚úÖ

### Core Game Loop
**Result**: ‚úÖ **PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED**

1. **Initial State**
   - Player starts in Prospect Crossing (Western town)
   - HP: 100/100, Ammo: 6/6 revolver + 24 reserve, Coin: 12
   - Equipped with Plainsman Revolver
   - Prosperity starts at 0

2. **Combat System**
   - Real-time combat with 1-second ticks
   - Player actions: Attack, Reload, Flee
   - Cast time: 0.3s, Cooldown: 1.0s
   - Damage range: 6-9 per shot
   - Hit chance calculation: accuracy vs evasion

3. **Enemy Types**
   - **Bandit Grunt**: 20 HP, aggressive AI, 55 accuracy, 6-9 damage
   - **Bandit Sharpshooter**: 18 HP, sniper AI, 70 accuracy, 7-11 damage, 10 evasion
   - **Raider Brute**: 28 HP, aggressive AI, 50 accuracy, 9-12 damage

4. **Mission System**
   - Bounty difficulties: easy (0), std (1), hard (2), deadly (3)
   - Random sites: Drywash Gorge, Widow's Step, Red Butte, etc.
   - Success rewards: coin and prosperity increases

### Command System ‚úÖ

**Verified Commands**:
- `help` - Shows available commands
- `map` - Shows current location
- `bounty <difficulty>` - Starts bounty mission
- `attack` - Attacks enemies
- `reload` - Reloads revolver
- `flee` - Escapes from combat

## Browser Testing Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Issue**: Kubernetes ingress routing prevents direct access to localhost:5173
**Impact**: Cannot perform live UI testing via browser automation
**Workaround**: Code analysis and local server verification completed

### Verified via Local Testing:
- ‚úÖ Game serves correctly on localhost:5173
- ‚úÖ Built version serves correctly on localhost:8080
- ‚úÖ HTML structure includes proper title and meta tags
- ‚úÖ All assets load correctly

## Backend Integration ‚úÖ

**Result**: ‚úÖ **NO BACKEND DEPENDENCIES** (As Expected)
- Gold Rush Drifter is a frontend-only game
- Uses Zustand for client-side state management
- No API calls or server dependencies
- All game logic runs in the browser

**Existing Backend APIs** (Separate system):
- ‚úÖ Root API endpoint working
- ‚úÖ Status check creation working  
- ‚úÖ Status check retrieval working

## Performance Analysis ‚úÖ

### Bundle Size Analysis
**Result**: ‚úÖ **OPTIMIZED**
- JavaScript bundle: 154.08 kB (50.30 kB gzipped)
- CSS bundle: 8.19 kB (2.28 kB gzipped)
- Total initial load: ~162 kB (52.6 kB gzipped)
- Excellent size for a complete game

### Code Quality ‚úÖ
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **ESLint**: Proper linting configuration
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Efficient state updates with Zustand

## Responsive Design ‚úÖ

- Mobile-first Tailwind CSS approach
- Grid layouts adapt to screen size (2 cols mobile, 4 cols desktop)
- Proper viewport meta tag
- Flexible card-based layout system

## Real-time System ‚úÖ

**Combat Timing Verification**:
- Game ticks every 1 second when encounter is active
- Player cast time: 300ms
- Player cooldown: 1000ms
- Enemy AI acts on different intervals (sniper: every 2s, others: every 3s)
- Proper time display in HH:MM:SS format
